# Requirements

* Vim 7.3+
* Emacs 24+
* ghc, cabal and ghc-mod installed

# Installation (Emacs)

Install emacs config using

    install_emacs.sh

On first startup, emacs package manager will install all required packages

# Installation (Vim)

Install vim configs using

    install_vim.sh

*Note*: Vim-configs are not currently actively developed. I generally try to use Emacs + evil-mode now.
