" # Commands that call Pandoc
"
" ## Simple Commands
"
" Markdown tidy with hard wraps
" (Note: this will insert an empty title block if no title block is present)

	:command! MarkdownTidyWrap %!pandoc -t markdown -s

" Markdown tidy without hard wraps
" (Note: this will insert an empty title block if no title block is present)

	:command! MarkdownTidy %!pandoc -t markdown --no-wrap -s

" ## Complex commands

" Two options here: commands the rely on an external wrapper script, "pd", and
" commands that don't.
"
" ### Commands that rely on "pd"
"
" I've written a bash wrapper script, "pd", which can be found here:
"
" 	https://gist.github.com/857619
"
" "pd" provides some shortcuts for common tasks, an easy way to
" set default conversion options. For details, read the comments in the
" script or try `pd help`.
"
" The advantage of calling "pd" here rather than pandoc is that you can
" set all your defaults once, and the conversions are available both in
" vim and from the cli.
"
" Below are some commands I use regularly. It should be easy to expand this
" list to suit your needs.
"
" Generate html (will be saved as filename.html)

	:command! MarkdownHtmlpd	!pd html %

" Generate html and open in default html viewer

	:command! MarkdownHtmlOpenpd !pd html open %

" Generate pdf using citeproc and open in default pdf viewer

	:command! MarkdownPdfCiteOpenpd !pd bib pdf open %

" Generate odt using citeproc and open in default odt viewer

	:command! MarkdownOdtCiteOpenpd !pd bib odt open %

" ### Commands that call pandoc directly
"
" Here are three more complicated pandoc commands that don't rely on pd. The
" advantage is that you don't need to provide those external scripts. The
" disadvantage is that you have to manage all the cli options here.
"
" Note that these commands depend on OS X's "open" command. Linux users will
" want to rewrite them to use the "xdg-open" command.
"
" Generate html and open in default html viewer

	:command! MarkdownHtmlOpen !out="%";out="${out\%.*}.html";pandoc -t html -sS -o "$out" %;open "$out"

" Generate pdf and open in default pdf viewer

  	:command! MarkdownPdfOpen !out="%";out="${out\%.*}.pdf";markdown2pdf -o "$out" %;open "$out"

" Generate odt and open in default odt viewer

	:command! MarkdownOdtOpen !out="%";out="${out\%.*}.odt";pandoc -t odt -sS -o "$out" %;open "$out"

" # Some suggested <Leader> mappings
"
" It is bad form to put <Leader> mappings in ftplugins. Here are the mappings I
" have in my .vimrc. If you like them, you can either copy them to your vimrc
" or uncomment them here.
"
"map <silent> <Leader>html :MarkdownHtmlOpenpd<CR>
"map <silent> <LEADER>pdf :MarkdownPdfCiteOpenpd<CR>
"map <silent> <LEADER>odt :MarkdownOdtCiteOpenpd<CR>
"
" While I'm at it, here are a few more functions mappings that are useful when
" editing pandoc files.
"
" Open link in browser (OS X only; based on Gruber's url regex)
"
" (This isn't very pandoc-specific, but I use it in the next mapping below.)
"
"ruby << EOF
"  def open_uri
"    re = %r{(?i)\b((?:[a-z][\w-]+:(?:/{1,3}|[a-z0-9%])|www\d{0,3}[.]|[a-z0-9.\-]+[.][a-z]{2,4}/)(?:[^\s()<>]+|\(([^\s()<>]+|(\([^\s()<>]+\)))*\))+(?:\(([^\s()<>]+|(\([^\s()<>]+\)))*\)|[^\s`!()\[\]{};:'".,<>?«»“”‘’]))}
